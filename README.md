### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!

- 📖 Portfolio:

  1- First project made 100% by me. 
    A Landingpage made with Node.js, React.js with typescript and using PHPMailer to send the form. 
    Firstborn son, father's pride. 
    You can check it at https://www.2asegurancaemive.com.br/.
    And if you are interested in hiring the service, my friend Thiago Lopes will be happy to assist you. 
    
  2- Personal project in progress.
    The BibleSearch project which consists of an application for searching Bible verses by keywords.
    For this i developed the database in SQLServer containing the bible and an inverted list to use the elastic search algorithm.
    For control and access to the database, I built a [Web API](https://github.com/Karosso-s/BibleSearchWebApi) in C# to do the search and return a Json to the Frontend.
    I am building the web [FrontEnd](https://github.com/Karosso-s/BibleSearchFrontEndWeb) in Angular, which will be responsible for returning the search result and breaking up a     verse    with an image to be shared on social networks. <br/>
    Future plans will be to optimize the database to increase the performance of the elastic search.
    Fot the Front-End as i'm working with React, my plans are to create a mobile application in React-Native and pass the web application to NextJs.
